# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions!

This year, I'm attempting to solve all [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2021) problems with the following constraints:
- Use TypeScript, a language I know little about and want to develop a deeper understanding of.
- Attempt solutions in as functional a style as possible without pulling in any helper libraries.
  This is to help me develop a good understanding of what's available with TypeScript/ES6 out
  of the box, and lets me run through the secondary exercise of building some higher-level
  functional tooling in a new language from the ground up.
- A complete script for a day should emit separate solutions for both parts. This is an added
  challenge to both keep a historical record of the part 1 solution instead of clobbering it
  for part 2 and as a challenge to extract relevant common components between the two.
