# Advent of Code 2021 Solutions!

This year, I'm attempting to solve all Advent of Code problems with the following constraints:
- Use TypeScript, a language I know little about and want to develop a deeper understanding of.
- Use no packages beyond typescript itself and its node annotations. This is to help me develop
  a good understanding of what's available with TypeScript/ES6 out of the box, and lets me run
  through the secondary exercise of building some higher-level functional tooling in a new
  language from the ground up, forcing some more advanced type system understanding.
